# Priority Email Bookmarklet

This bookmarklet streamlines the use of gmail by automatically applying the
filter:
`label:inbox | is:starred | is:unread | in:draft | label:meta-needs_attention | has:nouserlabels `

If you are already signed into gmail in the current window, this shortcut will
apply the filter to the profile in use.

To get the icon to work, make sure to go to about:config and set 
toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets to true.
