# Priority Email Bookmarklet

This bookmarklet streamlines the use of gmail by automatically applying the
filter:
`label:inbox | is:starred | is:unread | in:draft | label:meta-needs_attention`

If you are already signed into gmail in the current window, this shortcut will
apply the filter to the profile in use.
